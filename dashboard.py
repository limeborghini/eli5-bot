# use quart? will work well with discord api i think
#

# for dashboard
#   create authentication system using OAuth2
#   possible info to display
#      server status,
#      connected server
#      most recent request pushed to sql database
#   back end will use flask/quart which ever is better
#   front end, if we want to do js then React, or we can see about Shiny(python based)


# not sure if this belongs in dashboard
#   commands, need to have explain command
#   ask group what other commands are needed
